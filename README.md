# Joystick Emulator

A network-based joystick emulator implemented using Python socket programming. This project consists of a server that displays the joystick position and a client that controls the movement using keyboard input.

## Features

- Real-time joystick movement simulation
- Client-server architecture using TCP/IP sockets
- Cross-computer compatibility with proper network configuration
- Visual feedback with colored display
- Server available as both Python script and executable
- Automatic IP address display for easy connection
- Comprehensive error handling and timeout management

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)
- Windows operating system (uses msvcrt for keyboard input)
- Network connectivity between client and server computers

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mivige/SocketsJoystick.git
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage

### Server Setup (JoystickPantalla)

1. Run the server using either:
   - Python script: `python JoystickPantalla.py`
   - Executable: Run `JoystickPantalla.exe`
2. Note the IP address displayed on the server window

### Client Setup (JoystickTeclado)

1. Open `JoystickTeclado.py` and update the `SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` on line 17 with the server's IP
2. Run the client: `python JoystickTeclado.py`

### Controls

- W: Move up
- S: Move down
- A: Move left
- D: Move right
- R: Reset position
- Q: Quit

## Network Configuration

### Troubleshooting

If connection fails:
1. Verify both computers are on the same network subnet
2. Check Windows Firewall settings
3. Ensure network profile is set to "Private"
4. Test basic connectivity using ping
5. Verify the correct IP address is being used

### Required Setup

1. Configure Windows Firewall:
   - Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
   - Create new Inbound Rule for TCP port 10000
   - Allow the connection for all profiles

2. Set Network Profile:
   - Open Windows Settings > Network & Internet
   - Set network profile to "Private"

3. Verify Connection:
   - Both computers must be on the same network
   - Test connectivity using ping command
   - Ensure port 10000 is not blocked by network policy
